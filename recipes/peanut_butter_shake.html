        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This recipe is one that I utilize every afternoon. It is of a peanut butter shake with honey, milk and oats. 
            This recipe was inspired by my local gym where they offer this shake as a post workout drink. I decided to try 
            to replicate this shake at home to save some money and improve my skills in the kitchen!
